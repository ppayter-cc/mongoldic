Possible functions in the future (aka to-do list for me):
* autocomplete (needs JS)
* synonyms (get & highlight '=someword' strings from the descriptions, maybe create links for them)
* removing hyphens where they shouldn't be (in the middle of Hungarian words usually)
* conjugated forms (not sure how to do that algorithmically)
* editing words (saving them to the production db only after moderation)
* search/minute limit (with captcha?)
* proper error pages ( :) )
* translating the UI to Mongolian (need an editor for this)
