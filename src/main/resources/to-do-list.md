#### Possible functions in the future (aka to-do list for me):

**User-suggested ideas:**
* autocomplete/suggestions (AJAX, needs JS)
* suggestions at the beginning of the result list in case the user mistyped something (needs further research & consultation)
* synonyms (there are synonyms in the descriptions - maybe get & highlight '=someword' strings and possible synonyms from the descriptions, maybe create links for them)
* [waiting for possible new source without hyphens] removing hyphens from the descriptions where they shouldn't be (in the middle of Hungarian words usually, because the original material was formatted for printing)
* conjugated forms (not sure how to do that algorithmically, unless cutting off the last X characters)
* [done] search whole words in descriptions
* translating the UI to Mongolian (need an editor for this)
---
**Developer's ideas:**
* editing words (saving them to the production DB only after moderation)
* [unnecessary?] search/second limit (with captcha?)
* [done] proper error pages
* [done] nicer URLs
* android app
* most searched words
* word of the day (not just random words)
* [in progress] more tests ( :) )
* save the classical form of the words into separate column
* [done] separate html into fragments
