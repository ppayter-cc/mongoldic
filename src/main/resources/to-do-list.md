#### Possible functions in the future (aka to-do list for me):

**User-suggested ideas:**
* autocomplete/suggestions (AJAX, needs JS)
* suggestions at the beginning of the result list (in case the user mistyped something)
* synonyms (get & highlight '=someword' strings and possible synonyms from the descriptions, maybe create links for them)
* removing hyphens from the descriptions where they shouldn't be (in the middle of Hungarian words usually, because the original material was formatted for printing)
* conjugated forms (not sure how to do that algorithmically)
* search whole words in descriptions [done]
* translating the UI to Mongolian (need an editor for this)
---
**Developer's ideas:**
* editing words (saving them to the production DB only after moderation)
* search/minute limit (with captcha?)
* proper error pages ( :) )
* nicer URLs
* android app
* most searched words
* word of the day (not just random words)
* more tests ( :) )
